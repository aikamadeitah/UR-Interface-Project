# UR-User-Interface-Project

The goal of this project is to start development of a UI that can be run on a PC connected to the same network as the robot.

This project is in large parts about recieving message from the U.R robot, the received message then have to be decripted.
The movement of the U.R also needs to be controlled by a GUI.
